      "text": "Beaujolais Nouveau is a “cheerful and bold wine”, a bright, richly fruity, burning taste of which is determined by the features of its production. If the winemaker drains the wine a couple of hours earlier than necessary, then the young wine will be too light in taste and with a slightly pronounced color, but, on the contrary, do it a couple of hours later, then Beaujolais Nouveau risks being too dark, with an unconventional sparkling ruby color and enough tannin flavor  \n\nSuch a complex nature of Beaujolais is due to the soils on which Gamay grapes are cultivated - a black variety with white juice. The Beaujolais region seems to be specially created by nature for this grape.\n\nBeaujolais Nouveau is traditionally produced like other wines. But in order for the young wine to remain light, fresh and at the same time aromatic, with a bright fruity and berry taste, maceration is used for 4-5 days. For such an amount of time it is possible to get a maximum of fruit aromas, without excessive astringency.\n\nDuring production, young wine undergoes fermentation, becoming softer and reducing its acidity. Like most wines, the second fermentation allows Beaujolais Nouveau to achieve stability within a month after harvest. It is at this stage that the Beaujolais Nouveau wines are bottled.\n\nAnd just at that moment the holiday begins!\n\nThe tradition of celebrating Beaujolais Nuvo arose in the 19th century among winemakers in the Beaujolais region. Their wine ripened earlier than anyone else, grape harvesting began earlier than in other places, and the fermentation of wine took place during its transportation to the outskirts of Lyon. Due to the short ripening period, Beaujolais maintains lightness and aroma, which can be different from year to year, depending on the crop and climatic fluctuations.\n\nIn the old days, wine poured into the river on holiday - it was bottled in special bottles called “pot”. Until 1846, these were 1 liter bottles. They were called “Lyon bottle” (“Pot Lyonnais”) or “City bottle” (“Pot de ville”), and when its volume was reduced to the current traditional 46 cl - this led to almost an uprising among local drinkers who considered themselves deceived . Then it was decided to put 46 cl bottles on the bar, and buyers paid per meter (!), Measuring the length of a row of empty (drunk) “by”. As a rule, there were 12 bottles in the meter, and the thirteenth was usually offered free of charge “at the expense of the establishment”. It was then that the expression \"boyau rouge\" arose, that is, \"to be a good binge.\"\n\nThis tradition ceased to exist only during World War II, when the Germans introduced special taxes and rules for the sale of fine wines in France during the occupation. After the war, the French government introduced special rules for the sale of AOC wines.\n\nAt first, young wines were allowed to sell from November 13.

If the winemaker drains the wine a couple of hours earlier than necessary, then the young wine will be too light in taste and with a slightly pronounced color, but, on the contrary, do it a couple of hours later, then Beaujolais Nouveau risks being too dark, with an unconventional sparkling ruby color and enough tannin flavor  \n\nSuch a complex nature of Beaujolais is due to the soils on which Gamay grapes are cultivated - a black variety with white juice. The Beaujolais region seems to be specially created by nature for this grape.\n\nBeaujolais Nouveau is traditionally produced like other wines. But in order for the young wine to remain light, fresh and at the same time aromatic, with a bright fruity and berry taste, maceration is used for 4-5 days. For such an amount of time it is possible to get a maximum of fruit aromas, without excessive astringency.\n\nDuring production, young wine undergoes fermentation, becoming softer and reducing its acidity. Like most wines, the second fermentation allows Beaujolais Nouveau to achieve stability within a month after harvest. It is at this stage that the Beaujolais Nouveau wines are bottled.\n\nAnd just at that moment the holiday begins!\n\nThe tradition of celebrating Beaujolais Nuvo arose in the 19th century among winemakers in the Beaujolais region. Their wine ripened earlier than anyone else, grape harvesting began earlier than in other places, and the fermentation of wine took place during its transportation to the outskirts of Lyon. Due to the short ripening period, Beaujolais maintains lightness and aroma, which can be different from year to year, depending on the crop and climatic fluctuations.\n\nIn the old days, wine poured into the river on holiday - it was bottled in special bottles called “pot”. Until 1846, these were 1 liter bottles. They were called “Lyon bottle” (“Pot Lyonnais”) or “City bottle” (“Pot de ville”), and when its volume was reduced to the current traditional 46 cl - this led to almost an uprising among local drinkers who considered themselves deceived . Then it was decided to put 46 cl bottles on the bar, and buyers paid per meter (!), Measuring the length of a row of empty (drunk) “by”. As a rule, there were 12 bottles in the meter, and the thirteenth was usually offered free of charge “at the expense of the establishment”. It was then that the expression \"boyau rouge\" arose, that is, \"to be a good binge.\"\n\nThis tradition ceased to exist only during World War II, when the Germans introduced special taxes and rules for the sale of fine wines in France during the occupation. After the war, the French government introduced special rules for the sale of AOC wines.\n\nAt first, young wines were allowed to sell from November 13.

If the winemaker drains the wine a couple of hours earlier than necessary, then the young wine will be too light in taste and with a slightly pronounced color, but, on the contrary, do it a couple of hours later, then Beaujolais Nouveau risks being too dark, with an unconventional sparkling ruby color and enough tannin flavor  \n\nSuch a complex nature of Beaujolais is due to the soils on which Gamay grapes are cultivated - a black variety with white juice. The Beaujolais region seems to be specially created by nature for this grape.\n\nBeaujolais Nouveau is traditionally produced like other wines. But in order for the young wine to remain light, fresh and at the same time aromatic, with a bright fruity and berry taste, maceration is used for 4-5 days. For such an amount of time it is possible to get a maximum of fruit aromas, without excessive astringency.\n\nDuring production, young wine undergoes fermentation, becoming softer and reducing its acidity. Like most wines, the second fermentation allows Beaujolais Nouveau to achieve stability within a month after harvest. It is at this stage that the Beaujolais Nouveau wines are bottled.\n\nAnd just at that moment the holiday begins!\n\nThe tradition of celebrating Beaujolais Nuvo arose in the 19th century among winemakers in the Beaujolais region. Their wine ripened earlier than anyone else, grape harvesting began earlier than in other places, and the fermentation of wine took place during its transportation to the outskirts of Lyon. Due to the short ripening period, Beaujolais maintains lightness and aroma, which can be different from year to year, depending on the crop and climatic fluctuations.\n\nIn the old days, wine poured into the river on holiday - it was bottled in special bottles called “pot”. Until 1846, these were 1 liter bottles. They were called “Lyon bottle” (“Pot Lyonnais”) or “City bottle” (“Pot de ville”), and when its volume was reduced to the current traditional 46 cl - this led to almost an uprising among local drinkers who considered themselves deceived . Then it was decided to put 46 cl bottles on the bar, and buyers paid per meter (!), Measuring the length of a row of empty (drunk) “by”. As a rule, there were 12 bottles in the meter, and the thirteenth was usually offered free of charge “at the expense of the establishment”. It was then that the expression \"boyau rouge\" arose, that is, \"to be a good binge.\"\n\nThis tradition ceased to exist only during World War II, when the Germans introduced special taxes and rules for the sale of fine wines in France during the occupation. After the war, the French government introduced special rules for the sale of AOC wines.\n\nAt first, young wines were allowed to sell from November 13. Later, in 1985, they set the start date for the sale of the young Beaujolais - from the third Thursday of November. And preparations for the holiday begin in six days. Posters with the words “Le Beaujolais Nouveau est arrivé!” (Beaujolais Nouveau arrived!) Are hung out all over the world.\n\nHappy holiday, lovers of French wines!"
